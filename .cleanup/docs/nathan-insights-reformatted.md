## Flow of Meaning (Tafsīr Summary)

This section of Surah An-Nazi'at focuses on the story of Musa (peace be upon him) and his encounter with the tyrannical Pharaoh. Allah asks if the story of Musa has reached the listener, recounting how Allah called Musa in the sacred valley of Tuwa and commanded him to go to Pharaoh, who had transgressed all bounds.

Musa was instructed to invite Pharaoh to purify himself and be guided to his Lord, so that he may fear Allah. Musa then showed Pharaoh the greatest sign, but Pharaoh denied it and disobeyed. He turned his back and gathered his people, arrogantly declaring himself to be the supreme lord.

However, Allah seized Pharaoh with exemplary punishment, both in this life and the Hereafter, as a lesson and warning for those who would defy Allah. The passage then transitions to rhetorical questions about the creation of the heavens, highlighting Allah's power and the ease with which He can resurrect the dead, compared to the vastness of the universe He has created.
