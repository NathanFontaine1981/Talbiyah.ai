## Teacher Notes

### The Verb اِنتَهَى (intahā)

This verb has dual usage depending on context. In past tense masculine form اِنْتَهَى means "it ended" (e.g., الدَّرْسُ اِنْتَهَى - The lesson ended). The feminine form اِنْتَهَت is used with feminine nouns (e.g., السَّنَةُ اِنْتَهَت - The year ended). In the imperative form اِنْتَهِ with kasrah, it means "Stop!" — used when ordering someone to cease an action.

- اِنْتَهَى الدَّرْسُ - The lesson ended
- اِنْتَهَتِ السَّنَةُ - The year ended
- اِنْتَهِ! - Stop!

### Root Word Derivation: ق-ر-ب (q-r-b)

Understanding Arabic roots helps you unlock vocabulary. The root ق-ر-ب carries the core meaning of "nearness" or "closeness". From this single root we can derive many related words:

- قَرِيب - close, near (adjective)
- قَرُبَ - to be near (past tense verb)
- قُرْبَان - sacrifice/offering (noun - something brought near to Allah)
- أَقَارِب - relatives (plural noun - those who are close)
- تَقَرَّبَ - to draw near (Form V verb)

### Present Tense Pattern: أُفَاعِلُ

The Form III present tense follows the pattern أُفَاعِلُ for first person. This pattern is used for verbs that involve interaction or reciprocity. The verb سَاعَدَ (to help) conjugates as:

- أَنَا أُسَاعِدُ - I help
- أَنْتَ تُسَاعِدُ - you (m.) help
- هُوَ يُسَاعِدُ - he helps
- هِيَ تُسَاعِدُ - she helps

### Practical Vocabulary Strategy

When learning new vocabulary, always try to identify the root letters first. Then think of words you already know from that root and connect meanings through the root concept. This is how native Arabic speakers intuitively understand new words.

## Final Reflection

### Practice Prompts

**Root Analysis:** When you encounter a new Arabic word, ask: "What is its 3-letter root? What other words do I know from this root?"

**Daily Practice:** Try to use 3 words from today's vocabulary in sentences during your day.

**Connection to Quran:** Notice how the root ق-ر-ب appears in Quran when referring to drawing near to Allah, such as قُرْبَانًا (sacrifice/offering).
