Teacher: السلام عليكم Omar! How are you today?
Student: Wa alaikum assalam! I'm good, alhamdulillah. Ready for our lesson.

Teacher: Excellent! Today we're going to focus on talking about daily activities using verbs in different tenses. We'll learn how to express what you do every day, what you did yesterday, and what you will do tomorrow. This is very practical Arabic that you can use in conversations right away.

[00:01:30]
Teacher: Let's start with a simple question. أَيْنَ تَعْمَلُ؟ Do you know what this means?
Student: Hmm, ayna means where... and ta'mal is... work?
Teacher: Perfect! Yes, أَيْنَ تَعْمَلُ؟ means "Where do you work?" The verb تَعْمَلُ ta'malu is the present tense, second person masculine singular form. Let's practice the response.

[00:03:00]
Teacher: To answer, you would say: أَعْمَلُ فِي المَكْتَبِ - a'malu fil-maktab - "I work in the office." Notice how the verb changes? تَعْمَلُ becomes أَعْمَلُ for "I". The prefix changed from تَـ to أَ.
Student: Okay, so أَعْمَلُ means "I work"?
Teacher: Exactly! Now repeat after me: أَعْمَلُ فِي المَكْتَبِ
Student: A'malu fil-maktab.
Teacher: Good! But watch your pronunciation of the ع - it comes from deep in the throat. Try again: أَعْمَلُ
Student: أَعْمَلُ... a'malu.
Teacher: Much better! That ع sound is crucial.

[00:05:45]
Teacher: Now let's learn some common places. Listen carefully: المَكْتَب - the office, المَدْرَسَة - the school, المُسْتَشْفَى - the hospital, المَصْنَع - the factory, المَطْعَم - the restaurant.
Student: Can you repeat المُسْتَشْفَى? That one sounds complicated.
Teacher: Of course. المُسْتَشْفَى - al-mustashfa. It has that شْـ sound - shafa. The letters are م-س-ت-ش-ف-ى. Try it slowly.
Student: Al-mus-tash-fa... المُسْتَشْفَى
Teacher: Excellent pronunciation! You got it.

[00:08:20]
Teacher: Now, let's practice asking and answering. I'll ask you: أَيْنَ تَدْرُسُ؟ - Where do you study?
Student: Oh! أَدْرُسُ فِي... in the university?
Teacher: Yes! أَدْرُسُ فِي الجَامِعَةِ - I study at the university. Notice the verb changed again - from تَدْرُسُ to أَدْرُسُ. The pattern is the same as before.
Student: Right, the تَـ changes to أَ for "I". Got it.

[00:10:00]
Teacher: Perfect! Now let's talk about daily activities. I'll teach you some essential verbs. Ready?
Student: Yes, let's do it!

Teacher: أَكَلَ - akala - he ate. This is past tense. In present tense it becomes يَأْكُلُ - ya'kulu - he eats. And for "I eat" it's آكُلُ - akulu. Notice the hamza in آكُلُ.
Student: So akala is past, ya'kulu is present?
Teacher: Exactly! Let's practice with "drink" - شَرِبَ - shariba - he drank. Present tense: يَشْرَبُ - yashrabu - he drinks. For "I drink": أَشْرَبُ - ashrabu.

[00:13:15]
Student: Can I try making a sentence? أَشْرَبُ القَهْوَة - I drink coffee?
Teacher: Wonderful! Yes, أَشْرَبُ القَهْوَةَ فِي الصَّبَاحِ - I drink coffee in the morning. You're getting it! Let me teach you صَبَاح - sabah means morning, but we add the definite article: الصَّبَاح - as-sabah.

[00:15:30]
Teacher: Now let's talk about the future tense. This is really useful. In Arabic, we add the prefix سَـ or the word سَوْفَ before the present tense verb to make it future.
Student: So like English "will"?
Teacher: Exactly like "will"! For example: أَشْرَبُ means "I drink" but سَأَشْرَبُ means "I will drink." Try saying: سَأَشْرَبُ القَهْوَةَ غَدًا - I will drink coffee tomorrow.
Student: Sa-ashrabu al-qahwa... ghadan?
Teacher: Perfect! غَدًا means tomorrow. You pronounced the غ beautifully - that guttural sound from the back of the throat.

[00:18:00]
Teacher: Let's learn more daily verbs. ذَهَبَ - dhahaba - he went. Present: يَذْهَبُ - yadh-habu - he goes. Future: سَيَذْهَبُ - sa-yadh-habu - he will go.
Student: Okay, so for "I will go" it would be... سَأَذْهَبُ?
Teacher: Excellent! سَأَذْهَبُ إِلَى المَسْجِدِ - I will go to the mosque. إِلَى means "to" or "towards."

[00:21:00]
Teacher: Now let's practice "there is" and "there are" - this is very important. For masculine nouns we use يُوجَدُ - yujadu, and for feminine nouns we use تُوجَدُ - tujadu.
Student: How do I know which to use?
Teacher: Good question! If the noun is masculine, use يُوجَدُ. If it's feminine, use تُوجَدُ. For example: يُوجَدُ كِتَابٌ - there is a book. Kitab is masculine. But: تُوجَدُ مَدْرَسَةٌ - there is a school. Madrasa is feminine.

[00:23:45]
Student: What about "there are many"?
Teacher: Great question! We add the word كَثِيرٌ or كَثِيرَة. For example: تُوجَدُ كُتُبٌ كَثِيرَةٌ - there are many books. Or يُوجَدُ طُلَّابٌ كَثِيرُونَ - there are many students.

[00:25:30]
Teacher: Let me teach you about asking "how many?" - it's كَمْ. But here's the tricky part - after كَمْ, we always use the singular form of the noun, not plural!
Student: Wait, really? That seems backwards.
Teacher: I know! It's different from English. So you say: كَمْ كِتَابًا؟ - how many books? Not كُتُب. The word stays singular: كِتَابًا with tanween.
Student: Kam kitaban? Okay, I'll remember that.

[00:28:00]
Teacher: Now let's combine everything. I'll ask you: كَمْ سَاعَةً تَعْمَلُ فِي اليَوْمِ؟ - How many hours do you work per day?
Student: Umm... kam sa'a... how many hours... ta'mal fil-yawm?
Teacher: Perfect understanding! سَاعَة means hour, يَوْم means day. To answer you might say: أَعْمَلُ ثَمَانِيَ سَاعَاتٍ - I work eight hours. ثَمَانِيَ - thamaniya - is eight.

[00:31:00]
Teacher: Let's talk about daily routine vocabulary. Listen: أَسْتَيْقِظُ - astayqizu - I wake up. This comes from the root ي-ق-ظ. أَغْتَسِلُ - aghtasilu - I wash/bathe. أَتَنَاوَلُ - atanawalu - I eat/have a meal.
Student: These verbs sound more complex.
Teacher: They are Form X and Form V verbs - don't worry about the form numbers now, just learn them as vocabulary. The important thing is to recognize the patterns.

[00:34:15]
Teacher: Let's create a daily routine sentence together. أَسْتَيْقِظُ فِي السَّادِسَةِ صَبَاحًا - I wake up at 6 AM. السَّادِسَة means the sixth hour, صَبَاحًا means in the morning. Try it!
Student: Astayqizu fis-sadisa sabahan.
Teacher: Great! Now add: ثُمَّ أَغْتَسِلُ - then I wash. ثُمَّ means "then."
Student: Thumma aghtasilu.
Teacher: Perfect! One more: وَأَتَنَاوَلُ الفُطُورَ - and I have breakfast. الفُطُور is breakfast.

[00:37:00]
Teacher: I notice you're saying sayyafi instead of سَأَقْضِي for "I will spend." Let me correct that. It's sa-aq-di. The ق and the ض both need to be clear. Try: سَأَقْضِي العُطْلَةَ - I will spend the vacation.
Student: Sa-aq-di... that ق is hard!
Teacher: The ق comes from the very back of your throat, the uvula. Try making a "k" sound but deeper: ق ق ق
Student: ققق... okay, sa-aq-di al-'utla.
Teacher: Much better! Keep practicing that ق sound - it's one of the most important letters.

[00:40:30]
Teacher: Now let's learn about الفصول - the seasons, and talk about activities in different seasons. الرَّبِيعُ - spring, الصَّيْفُ - summer, الخَرِيفُ - autumn, الشِّتَاءُ - winter.
Student: Ar-rabi', as-sayf, al-kharif, ash-shita'?
Teacher: Excellent pronunciation! Notice the shadda on الشِّتَاء - that doubles the ش sound.

[00:42:00]
Teacher: Let's make sentences about the seasons. فِي الصَّيْفِ، أَذْهَبُ إِلَى الشَّاطِئِ - In summer, I go to the beach. الشَّاطِئ - ash-shati' - is beach. Notice when we say "in summer" we use فِي الصَّيْفِ with kasra at the end.
Student: So the ending changes?
Teacher: Yes! That's called i'rab - grammatical case endings. After prepositions like فِي we use kasra. But don't worry too much about that now - just know the endings can change.

[00:45:00]
Teacher: Let's practice more verbs with different objects. قَرَأَ - qara'a - he read. يَقْرَأُ - yaqra'u - he reads. سَيَقْرَأُ - sa-yaqra'u - he will read. Try: سَأَقْرَأُ الكِتَابَ - I will read the book.
Student: Sa-aqra'u al-kitab.
Teacher: Perfect! The hamza in قَرَأَ can be tricky. Make sure you pronounce it clearly: qara'a, not qaraa.

[00:48:00]
Teacher: Time for some prepositions of place. فِي - in, عَلَى - on, تَحْتَ - under, فَوْقَ - above, بَيْنَ - between, أَمَامَ - in front of, خَلْفَ - behind.
Student: Can we practice with sentences?
Teacher: Of course! الكِتَابُ عَلَى الطَّاوِلَةِ - The book is on the table. الكُرْسِيُّ تَحْتَ الطَّاوِلَةِ - The chair is under the table. Notice we don't use "is" - Arabic doesn't need a copula in present tense nominal sentences.

[00:51:00]
Teacher: Let's talk about professions quickly. مُعَلِّمٌ - teacher (masculine), مُعَلِّمَةٌ - teacher (feminine). طَبِيبٌ - doctor (m), طَبِيبَةٌ - doctor (f). مُهَنْدِسٌ - engineer (m), مُهَنْدِسَةٌ - engineer (f).
Student: So you just add ة for feminine?
Teacher: Usually, yes! The taa marbuta ة is a common feminine marker. But not always - there are irregular feminines too.

[00:53:30]
Teacher: For homework, I want you to write 5 sentences using the verbs we learned today in past, present, and future tenses. Also practice the pronunciation of ق and ع - these are crucial Arabic sounds that don't exist in English.
Student: Should I record myself reading them?
Teacher: Yes, that's a great idea! Record yourself and send it to me. I can give you pronunciation feedback.

[00:55:00]
Teacher: Let's do a quick review. Can you tell me "I will go to the school tomorrow"?
Student: سَأَذْهَبُ إِلَى المَدْرَسَةِ غَدًا
Teacher: Perfect! And "I drink coffee in the morning"?
Student: أَشْرَبُ القَهْوَةَ فِي الصَّبَاحِ
Teacher: Excellent! You've learned so much today. Make flashcards for all the vocabulary - especially the verbs in different tenses. Practice the throat sounds every day.

[00:57:00]
Student: Thank you so much, Ustadha Fatima! This was really helpful.
Teacher: You're very welcome, Omar! You're making great progress. Keep up the practice and I'll see you next lesson. مَعَ السَّلَامَة!
Student: Ma'a salama!
