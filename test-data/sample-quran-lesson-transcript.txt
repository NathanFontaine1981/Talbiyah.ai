Teacher: Assalamu alaikum Sarah! How are you today?

Student: Wa alaikum assalam Ustadh! I'm doing well, alhamdulillah. Ready for our lesson!

Teacher: Excellent! Today we're going to continue with Surah Al-Qasas, verses 20 through 28. These verses tell us about Prophet Musa (peace be upon him) leaving Egypt and his journey to Madyan. It's a powerful story full of lessons. Are you ready?

Student: Yes, I'm ready insha'Allah!

Teacher: Beautiful. Let's start with verse 20. The verse says: "And a man came from the farthest end of the city, running. He said, 'O Moses, indeed the eminent ones are conferring over you [whether] to kill you, so leave [the city]; indeed, I am to you of the sincere advisers.'"

Can you tell me what's happening here?

Student: Someone is warning Musa (alayhi salam) that Fir'aun and his people want to kill him?

Teacher: Exactly right! This man rushed from the far side of the city to warn Musa. The Arabic word used here is "يَسْعَىٰ" (yas'aa) which means running or hastening. This shows urgency and sincerity. He risked his own safety to help Musa.

Student: That's brave of him!

Teacher: Absolutely. And notice he says "إِنِّي لَكَ مِنَ النَّاصِحِينَ" (innee laka minan-naasiheen) - "I am truly sincere to you in giving advice." The word "نَاصِح" (naasih) comes from the root ن-ص-ح which means sincerity and purity in advice. True advice comes from a pure heart.

Now, verse 21 tells us Musa's response. He says: "So he left it, fearful and anticipating [apprehension]. He said, 'My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people.'"

What do you notice about his dua here?

Student: He's asking Allah for protection... and he admits he's afraid?

Teacher: Yes! This is so important. Musa, one of the greatest prophets, felt fear - "خَائِفًا" (khaa'ifan). But what did he do with that fear? He turned to Allah immediately! "رَبِّ نَجِّنِي مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ" (Rabbi najjinee minal-qawmidh-dhaalimeen) - "My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people."

The word "نَجِّنِي" (najjinee) is from the root ن-ج-و meaning to save or rescue. It's a desperate, heartfelt plea. And notice he calls them "الظَّالِمِينَ" (adh-dhaalimeen) - the wrongdoers, those who oppress.

Student: So it's okay to feel fear, but we should turn to Allah?

Teacher: Perfectly said! Fear is human, but tawakkul - reliance on Allah - is what transforms that fear into strength.

Now, verses 22 to 28 describe Musa's arrival in Madyan and meeting the family of Prophet Shu'ayb. In verse 23, Musa sees two women waiting with their flock. They say: "We cannot water [our flocks] until the shepherds dispatch [their flocks]; and our father is an old man."

What does this tell us about them?

Student: They're helping their father even though it's hard for them... they're respectful and modest?

Teacher: Excellent observation! They explained their situation - they can't push through the crowd of male shepherds, and they're helping their elderly father. The Arabic word "شَيْخٌ كَبِيرٌ" (shaykhun kabeer) means an old, venerable man. They showed respect and modesty.

And what did Musa do in response?

Student: He helped them water their animals!

Teacher: Yes! Verse 24 says "فَسَقَىٰ لَهُمَا" (fa-saqaa lahumaa) - "So he watered [their flocks] for them." Despite being tired, hungry, and fleeing for his life, Musa helped them. This shows his noble character - prophets are always people of service.

Then he went to sit in the shade and made a beautiful dua: "My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need."

The word "فَقِيرٌ" (faqeer) here means desperately in need. He's not asking for something specific - he's expressing complete dependence on Allah. This is the essence of dua!

Student: SubhanAllah, that's so beautiful!

Teacher: Indeed! And look what happens next - Allah sent him provision in the most unexpected way. One of the women came back shyly and invited him to meet her father, who wanted to reward him. The Arabic says "تَمْشِي عَلَى اسْتِحْيَاءٍ" (tamshee 'alaa istihyaa') - she walked with modesty and shyness.

Her father, Prophet Shu'ayb, offered Musa food and eventually marriage to his daughter, with the condition that Musa work for him for eight or ten years. Verse 27: "He said, 'Indeed, I wish to wed you one of these, my two daughters, on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years.'"

What lessons do you see in this?

Student: Um... that Allah provides when we're sincere? And that good character is important?

Teacher: Both excellent points! Let me add a few more:

1. Allah sends help through unexpected means - Musa fled Egypt with nothing, and Allah gave him safety, work, and a family.

2. Good character opens doors - his simple act of helping led to everything he needed.

3. Hard work and halal provision - Musa didn't ask for charity; he agreed to work for eight years. This is dignity in earning.

4. Modesty and proper conduct - notice how respectfully everyone interacted.

5. Trusting Allah's plan - sometimes running away from danger leads us to our destiny.

The word "أَجْر" (ajr) appears here meaning both "reward" and "wages" - when we work with the right intention, our work becomes worship!

Student: This is amazing! I never thought about these verses this deeply before.

Teacher: That's what tadabbur is all about - reflecting deeply on Allah's words. One more thing - after all this, verse 28 says Musa agreed, and there was a agreement between them. The father said: "That is [established] between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete - there is no injustice to me."

The word "وَكِيلٌ" (wakeel) at the end means Allah is the Witness and Guardian over their agreement. This shows us to always involve Allah in our dealings!

Student: SubhanAllah! So many lessons from just a few verses!

Teacher: Exactly! The Quran is an ocean - the more you dive, the more pearls you find. For homework this week, I want you to:

1. Memorize at least verses 20-22
2. Write down three personal lessons you can apply from this story
3. Find one more word from these verses and research its root meaning
4. Reflect on a time when Allah sent you help in an unexpected way

Can you do that insha'Allah?

Student: Yes insha'Allah! I'm excited to work on this!

Teacher: Wonderful! Remember, the goal isn't just to know the story - it's to live by its lessons. When you face difficulty, remember Musa's dua. When you see someone in need, remember his helping the two women. When you need provision, remember his tawakkul.

Student: JazakAllahu khairan Ustadh! This was such a beneficial lesson!

Teacher: Wa iyyaki! May Allah make the Quran a light for you in this life and the next. Practice your recitation of these verses too - I'll check them next lesson insha'Allah.

Student: Ameen! See you next week insha'Allah!

Teacher: Insha'Allah! As-salamu alaikum!

Student: Wa alaikum assalam wa rahmatullah!
