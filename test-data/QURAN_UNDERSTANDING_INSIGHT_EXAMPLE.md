## 1️⃣ Lesson Summary

This lesson covered the pivotal moment when Prophet Musa (peace be upon him) fled Egypt after being warned of Fir'aun's plot to kill him. The passages detail his desperate escape, his arrival in Madyan, his noble act of helping two women water their flocks, and his eventual meeting with Prophet Shu'ayb's family. The lesson emphasized profound themes of tawakkul (reliance on Allah), turning fear into strength through dua, good character opening unexpected doors, and trusting in Allah's perfect plan even in moments of crisis. Multiple Arabic vocabulary words were explored through their root meanings to deepen comprehension of the nuanced messages within these verses.

## 2️⃣ Ayah-by-Ayah Breakdown

**Ayah 20:** وَجَاءَ رَجُلٌ مِّنْ أَقْصَى الْمَدِينَةِ يَسْعَىٰ قَالَ يَا مُوسَىٰ إِنَّ الْمَلَأَ يَأْتَمِرُونَ بِكَ لِيَقْتُلُوكَ فَاخْرُجْ إِنِّي لَكَ مِنَ النَّاصِحِينَ

**Translation:** "And a man came from the farthest end of the city, running. He said, 'O Moses, indeed the eminent ones are conferring over you [whether] to kill you, so leave [the city]; indeed, I am to you of the sincere advisers.'"

**Key Message:** A sincere believer risks his own safety to warn Musa of imminent danger.

**Teacher's Explanation:** The teacher highlighted the urgency shown by the word "يَسْعَىٰ" (yas'aa - running/hastening), indicating the man rushed from the far side of the city. The phrase "إِنِّي لَكَ مِنَ النَّاصِحِينَ" (I am truly sincere to you) was analyzed through its root ن-ص-ح (n-s-h), showing that true advice comes from a pure, sincere heart with no ulterior motives.

**Connection:** This verse immediately follows Musa's accidental killing of the Egyptian and sets up his forced exile, which becomes the means through which Allah guides him to his destiny.

---

**Ayah 21:** فَخَرَجَ مِنْهَا خَائِفًا يَتَرَقَّبُ ۖ قَالَ رَبِّ نَجِّنِي مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ

**Translation:** "So he left it, fearful and anticipating [apprehension]. He said, 'My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people.'"

**Key Message:** Even prophets feel fear, but they immediately turn to Allah with sincere supplication.

**Teacher's Explanation:** The teacher emphasized that Musa, despite being a prophet, experienced genuine fear - "خَائِفًا" (khaa'ifan). However, his response was to make dua immediately, not to rely on his own strength. The word "نَجِّنِي" (najjinee) from root ن-ج-و means to save or rescue - a desperate, heartfelt plea. He called Fir'aun's people "الظَّالِمِينَ" (the oppressors), correctly identifying their injustice.

**Connection:** This dua represents the transition from crisis to tawakkul, setting the spiritual foundation for what follows.

---

**Ayah 22:** وَلَمَّا تَوَجَّهَ تِلْقَاءَ مَدْيَنَ قَالَ عَسَىٰ رَبِّي أَن يَهْدِيَنِي سَوَاءَ السَّبِيلِ

**Translation:** "And when he directed himself toward Madyan, he said, 'Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the sound way.'"

**Key Message:** Complete trust in Allah's guidance even when the path ahead is uncertain.

**Teacher's Explanation:** Musa didn't know where he was going or what would happen, but he had hope - "عَسَىٰ" (perhaps/I hope). He asked for guidance to "سَوَاءَ السَّبِيلِ" (the sound way), showing that when we're lost, Allah knows the right path for us.

**Connection:** This hope and trust in Allah's guidance directly leads to the provision he's about to receive.

---

**Ayah 23:** وَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَاءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ وَوَجَدَ مِن دُونِهِمُ امْرَأَتَيْنِ تَذُودَانِ ۖ قَالَ مَا خَطْبُكُمَا ۖ قَالَتَا لَا نَسْقِي حَتَّىٰ يُصْدِرَ الرِّعَاءُ ۖ وَأَبُونَا شَيْخٌ كَبِيرٌ

**Translation:** "And when he came to the well of Madyan, he found there a crowd of people watering [their flocks], and he found aside from them two women driving back [their flocks]. He said, 'What is your circumstance?' They said, 'We cannot water until the shepherds dispatch [their flocks]; and our father is an old man.'"

**Key Message:** Modest women explain their difficult situation with dignity and respect.

**Teacher's Explanation:** The women were waiting because they couldn't push through the crowd of male shepherds. The phrase "شَيْخٌ كَبِيرٌ" (an old, venerable man) shows they were explaining why they, as women, had to do this difficult task - they were helping their elderly father. This demonstrated their modesty, respect, and family values.

**Connection:** This sets up Musa's next action, which demonstrates prophetic character through selfless service.

---

**Ayah 24:** فَسَقَىٰ لَهُمَا ثُمَّ تَوَلَّىٰ إِلَى الظِّلِّ فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي لِمَا أَنزَلْتَ إِلَيَّ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَقِيرٌ

**Translation:** "So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the shade and said, 'My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need.'"

**Key Message:** Prophets serve others despite their own difficulties, then express complete dependence on Allah.

**Teacher's Explanation:** Despite being exhausted, hungry, and fleeing for his life, Musa helped them - "فَسَقَىٰ لَهُمَا" (he watered for them). Then he made one of the most beautiful duas: he called himself "فَقِيرٌ" (faqeer - desperately in need). He didn't ask for something specific; he simply expressed total dependence on Allah for any good He might send. This is the essence of proper supplication.

**Connection:** This dua is immediately answered in the most unexpected way, showing how Allah responds to sincere need.

---

**Ayah 25:** فَجَاءَتْهُ إِحْدَاهُمَا تَمْشِي عَلَى اسْتِحْيَاءٍ قَالَتْ إِنَّ أَبِي يَدْعُوكَ لِيَجْزِيَكَ أَجْرَ مَا سَقَيْتَ لَنَا ۚ فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُ وَقَصَّ عَلَيْهِ الْقَصَصَ قَالَ لَا تَخَفْ ۖ نَجَوْتَ مِنَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ

**Translation:** "Then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness. She said, 'Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us.' So when he came to him and related to him the story, he said, 'Fear not. You have escaped from the wrongdoing people.'"

**Key Message:** Allah's provision arrives through unexpected means with perfect timing.

**Teacher's Explanation:** The woman returned "تَمْشِي عَلَى اسْتِحْيَاءٍ" (walking with modesty and shyness) - showing proper Islamic conduct. Her father (Prophet Shu'ayb) wanted to reward Musa using the word "أَجْرَ" which means both "reward" and "wages," showing that halal work is dignified. When Musa told his story, Shu'ayb reassured him: "نَجَوْتَ" (you have escaped) - confirming that his dua was answered.

**Connection:** This meeting becomes the foundation for Musa's next phase of life, proving Allah's perfect planning.

---

**Ayah 26:** قَالَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا يَا أَبَتِ اسْتَأْجِرْهُ ۖ إِنَّ خَيْرَ مَنِ اسْتَأْجَرْتَ الْقَوِيُّ الْأَمِينُ

**Translation:** "One of the women said, 'O my father, hire him. Indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy.'"

**Key Message:** True quality in a person is measured by strength of character and trustworthiness.

**Teacher's Explanation:** The daughter recognized two essential qualities: "الْقَوِيُّ" (the strong) - physical capability, and "الْأَمِينُ" (the trustworthy) - moral integrity. These are the criteria Islam values in leadership and work. Her wisdom in identifying these qualities shows the intelligence and insight of righteous women.

**Connection:** This recommendation leads directly to the marriage proposal that follows.

---

**Ayah 27:** قَالَ إِنِّي أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُنكِحَكَ إِحْدَى ابْنَتَيَّ هَاتَيْنِ عَلَىٰ أَن تَأْجُرَنِي ثَمَانِيَ حِجَجٍ ۖ فَإِنْ أَتْمَمْتَ عَشْرًا فَمِنْ عِندِكَ ۖ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَنْ أَشُقَّ عَلَيْكَ ۚ سَتَجِدُنِي إِن شَاءَ اللَّهُ مِنَ الصَّالِحِينَ

**Translation:** "He said, 'Indeed, I wish to wed you one of these, my two daughters, on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be [as a favor] from you. And I do not wish to put you in difficulty. You will find me, if Allah wills, from among the righteous.'"

**Key Message:** Dignified work is the means to halal provision and marriage; mercy in agreements is from righteousness.

**Teacher's Explanation:** Shu'ayb offered marriage but with the condition of work - eight years required, ten years optional. This shows that earning through honest labor is dignified and preferred over charity. He added "وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَنْ أَشُقَّ عَلَيْكَ" (I don't wish to make it difficult for you), showing mercy and fairness. He ended with "إِن شَاءَ اللَّهُ" (if Allah wills), demonstrating tawakkul and humility even in his own promises.

**Connection:** This generous offer is the culmination of Allah's provision that began with Musa's simple act of service.

---

**Ayah 28:** قَالَ ذَٰلِكَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ ۖ أَيَّمَا الْأَجَلَيْنِ قَضَيْتُ فَلَا عُدْوَانَ عَلَيَّ ۖ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ مَا نَقُولُ وَكِيلٌ

**Translation:** "He said, 'That is [established] between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete - there is no injustice to me, and Allah, over what we say, is Witness.'"

**Key Message:** Make Allah the witness over your agreements.

**Teacher's Explanation:** Musa accepted the agreement, clarifying that whether he completes eight or ten years, there's no injustice either way. Most importantly, he ended with "وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ مَا نَقُولُ وَكِيلٌ" (Allah is Witness over what we say). The word "وَكِيلٌ" (Wakeel) means both Witness and Guardian - showing that we should always involve Allah in our dealings, making Him the ultimate guarantor of our agreements.

**Connection:** This completes the transformation from fleeing Egypt with nothing to having safety, work, provision, and family - all through tawakkul.

## 3️⃣ Flow of Meaning (Tafsīr Summary)

**Main Narrative Arc:**

These verses present a complete story of trial, trust, and divine provision. The passage begins with extreme crisis - Musa must flee Egypt to save his life. It then follows his journey of uncertainty to Madyan, where he doesn't know what awaits him. Through a simple act of kindness (helping two women), Allah opens doors he never imagined: safety from his enemies, meaningful work, and a family. The narrative demonstrates how Allah's plan unfolds through seemingly ordinary events when we maintain tawakkul.

**Progression:**
1. **Crisis & Escape (20-21):** Urgent warning → Musa's fearful departure → Immediate dua for safety
2. **Journey & Hope (22):** Travel to unknown destination → Dua for guidance → Complete trust in Allah
3. **Arrival & Service (23-24):** Finding people in need → Selfless help despite exhaustion → Dua expressing need
4. **Provision & Safety (25):** Unexpected invitation → Meeting Shu'ayb → Reassurance of safety
5. **Offer & Agreement (26-28):** Recognition of character → Marriage proposal tied to work → Agreement with Allah as Witness

**Key Transitions:**
- From **fear to faith** (verse 21): Musa transforms his natural human fear into immediate reliance on Allah through dua
- From **service to provision** (verses 23-25): His selfless act becomes the means of his sustenance
- From **refugee to family member** (verses 26-28): From fleeing with nothing to gaining everything

**Classical Tafsir Insights:**

**Ibn Kathir** explains that the man who warned Musa in verse 20 was a believer from among Fir'aun's people who concealed his faith, showing that even in the darkest regimes, Allah plants allies for His prophets. The urgency of his running from the far end of the city emphasizes the seriousness of the threat.

**At-Tabari** notes that Musa's dua in verse 24 - "I am in need of any good You send" - was answered within minutes when the woman returned. This demonstrates how quickly Allah responds to sincere supplication made in a state of complete dependence.

**Ibn Qayyim** highlights that Musa worked for 8-10 years as the mahr (dowry) for his wife, establishing an important precedent that work and service are dignified forms of mahr, and that earning one's provision through honest labor is beloved to Allah.

**Qurtubi** explains that the word "وَكِيلٌ" (Wakeel - Witness/Guardian) in verse 28 teaches Muslims to always make Allah the third party in their agreements, ensuring honesty and integrity in all contracts.

**Historical Context:**

This event occurs after Musa killed an Egyptian man by accident while defending an Israelite, and Fir'aun discovered it. Madyan was located on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Aqaba, requiring a long, difficult journey through the desert - likely several days of walking in harsh conditions with no provisions. That Musa survived this journey itself was a miracle from Allah.

The identity of "شَيْخٌ كَبِيرٌ" (the old man) is understood by most scholars to be Prophet Shu'ayb (عليه السلام), the same prophet sent to the people of Madyan generations earlier, though some scholars suggest it was another righteous elder from Shu'ayb's lineage.

## 5️⃣ Key Lessons & Tadabbur Points

### 1. **Turn Fear Into Faith Through Immediate Dua**

When faced with crisis, Prophet Musa (عليه السلام) felt genuine fear - he was human after all. But what distinguished him was his immediate response: he turned to Allah in supplication. "My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people" was his cry while fleeing. This teaches us that feeling fear is natural and not a sign of weak faith, but the test is: what do we do with that fear?

*Application:* The next time you face anxiety, uncertainty, or fear - at work, in relationships, regarding health, or finances - make it a habit to immediately turn that fear into a dua. Don't let fear paralyze you; let it drive you to your knees in prayer. Create a "crisis dua" that you've memorized for such moments.

### 2. **Good Character Opens Unexpected Doors**

Musa was exhausted, hungry, fleeing for his life, and had nothing. Yet when he saw two women struggling, he helped them without expecting anything in return. This one act of selfless service led to everything he needed: safety, work, income, and a family. Allah's provision came through the door of good character, not through scheming or planning.

*Application:* Never be too busy, too tired, or too consumed by your own problems to help others. That small act of kindness - helping a colleague, serving your family, assisting a neighbor - might be the very key Allah uses to unlock your provision. Make it a daily goal to do one act of service without expecting anything in return.

### 3. **Express Complete Dependence on Allah Without Specifying How He Should Provide**

Musa's dua was remarkable: "My Lord, indeed I am in need of whatever good You send down to me." He didn't say "I need food" or "I need money" or "I need shelter." He expressed total need while leaving the means entirely to Allah's wisdom. This is the essence of tawakkul - acknowledging our complete dependence while trusting Allah's infinite knowledge of what's best for us.

*Application:* In your duas, try this approach: instead of always specifying exactly what you want and how you want it, sometimes simply say: "Ya Allah, I am in desperate need of Your mercy, Your provision, Your guidance. Send me whatever good You know is best for me." Trust that Allah's choice for you is better than your choice for yourself.

### 4. **Halal Provision Through Honest Work is More Dignified Than Charity**

Prophet Shu'ayb could have simply given Musa charity - he clearly had the means. Instead, he offered him dignified work (8-10 years of service) as the mahr for his daughter. This established that earning through honest labor, even when you're in desperate need, is the preferred path in Islam. The word "أَجْر" used means both wages and reward, showing that work done with the right intention is worship.

*Application:* Always seek to earn your provision through halal work rather than depending on handouts when you're capable of working. If you're in a position to help others, help them in ways that preserve their dignity - offer work, training, or opportunities rather than just handouts. Teach this value to your children.

### 5. **Allah's Plan is Perfect Even When You're Running Away From Danger**

Musa was fleeing Egypt to save his life - it looked like disaster. But Allah was leading him to exactly where he needed to be. In Madyan, he found safety, work, family, and years of preparation for his future mission as a prophet. Sometimes what looks like running away from trouble is actually running toward your destiny.

*Application:* When you face setbacks, job losses, relocations, or unexpected changes that feel like you're "fleeing" from one situation, trust that Allah might be directing you to something better. Keep your trust in "سَوَاءَ السَّبِيلِ" - Allah's straight path - even when you can't see where it leads. Keep a journal to record how Allah turned your past "disasters" into blessings, and review it during difficult times.

## 6️⃣ Reflection Questions

1. **When was the last time you felt genuine fear or anxiety, and did you immediately turn to Allah with dua as Musa did, or did you try to handle it on your own first?** Reflect on what usually stops you from making dua your first response rather than your last resort.

2. **Think of a time when a small act of kindness or service led to unexpected blessings in your life.** How can you increase these "Musa moments" - helping others even when you're going through your own difficulties? Who in your life right now could benefit from your service?

3. **What names or attributes of Allah are revealed through these verses?** Consider: Ar-Razzaq (The Provider), Al-Haadi (The Guide), Al-Wakeel (The Trustee), As-Sami' (The All-Hearing of dua), Al-Mujib (The Responder). How does reflecting on these names increase your trust in Him?

4. **If you were to make a dua like Musa's - "My Lord, I am in desperate need of whatever good You send" - while leaving the details to Allah, what situation in your life would you make this dua about?** What would it require you to let go of in terms of control and expectations?

5. **How does knowing that Prophet Musa felt fear, worked for years for his provision, and went through uncertainty change your perception of prophets and your own struggles?** Does it make their examples more relatable and applicable to your life?
