  "transcript": "Arabic Language Lesson - Quran Recitation and Memorization\nTeacher: Ustadh Osama Muhammad  \nStudent: Nathan Fontaine\nDate: November 9, 2025\nSubject: Surah An-Nazi'at (The Extractors)\nVerses: 79:15-26\n\n[Lesson starts after some administrative discussion about classroom setup]\n\nOsama Muhammad: Salamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh!\n\nNathan Fontaine: Wa alaikum assalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. I'm good, thanks. Just sorting out some classroom logistics.\n\nOsama Muhammad: No problem. Are you ready now? Things are busy today!\n\nNathan Fontaine: Yes, I'm focused and ready now.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim. Let's read the first part of Surah An-Nazi'at.\n\nNathan Fontaine: [Reciting] Yaquluna a inna lamarduduna fil hafirah. A idha kunna idhaaman nakhirah. Qalu tilka idhan karratun khasirah. Fa innama hiya zajratun wahidah. Fa idha hum bis sahirah.\n\nNathan Fontaine: Hal ataka hadithu Musa. Idh nadahu Rabbuhu bilwadil muqaddasi tuwa. Idh hab ila fir'awna innahu tagha. Faqul hal laka ila an tazakka. Wa ahdiyaka ila rabbika fatakhsha.\n\n[Practicing pronunciation and memorization]\n\nOsama Muhammad: That's good! Now, this section is about Musa. Let's focus on it. Read it again one more time, and then you're going to say it without looking.\n\nNathan Fontaine: [Re-reading] Hal ataka hadithu Musa. When his Lord called him in the holy valley of Tuwa. Idh hab ila fir'awna innahu tagha - Go to Pharaoh, indeed he has transgressed. Faqul hal laka ila an tazakka - And say to him, would you [be willing] to purify yourself?\n\nOsama Muhammad: Yes, excellent. Do you think you can do it without looking now?\n\nNathan Fontaine: I think I can do the first part. Let me try.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Okay, let's do it from the beginning. \"Did the story of Moses come to you?\"\n\nNathan Fontaine: [Reciting from memory] Hal ataka hadithu Musa. Idh nadahu Rabbuhu bilwadil muqaddasi tuwa. Idh hab ila fir'awna innahu tagha. Faqul hal laka ila an tazakka. Wa ahdiyaka ila rabbika fatakhsha.\n\nOsama Muhammad: MashaAllah! Very good. Now let's continue with the next part - when Musa showed Fir'aun the great sign.\n\nNathan Fontaine: Fa arahu al-ayatal kubra. Fakadhdaba wa 'asa. Thumma adbara yas'a. Fahashara fanada. Faqala ana rabbukumul a'la.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Good! \"He showed him the greatest sign. But he denied and disobeyed. Then he turned his back, striving.\" What does this mean?\n\nNathan Fontaine: It means Fir'aun saw the miracle from Musa but he still rejected it and turned away. He went and gathered his people.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Exactly! And then what did he say?\n\nNathan Fontaine: He said \"Ana rabbukumul a'la\" - I am your lord, most high.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Yes, this is the height of arrogance! Fir'aun claimed divinity. Now read the next verse about what Allah did.\n\nNathan Fontaine: Fa akhadahullahu nakala lil akhirati wal ula. Inna fi dhalika la'ibratan liman yakhsha.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Perfect! \"So Allah seized him with exemplary punishment for the last and the first [transgression]. Indeed in that is a warning for whoever would fear [Allah].\" This is a powerful reminder. Allah punished Fir'aun as an example for all who come after.\n\nNathan Fontaine: The word \"nakala\" - that means punishment?\n\nOsama Muhammad: Yes, نَكَال (nakaal) means exemplary punishment, something that serves as a deterrent and warning to others. It's from the root ن-ك-ل which carries the meaning of restraining and making an example.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Now let's practice this section all together. Can you do it from memory?\n\nNathan Fontaine: [Reciting] Hal ataka hadithu Musa. Idh nadahu Rabbuhu bilwadil muqaddasi tuwa. Idh hab ila fir'awna innahu tagha. Faqul hal laka ila an tazakka. Wa ahdiyaka ila rabbika fatakhsha. Fa arahu al-ayatal kubra. Fakadhdaba wa 'asa. Thumma adbara yas'a. Fahashara fanada. Faqala ana rabbukumul a'la. Fa akhadahullahu nakala lil akhirati wal ula. Inna fi dhalika la'ibratan liman yakhsha.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Excellent! MashaAllah, you've got it memorized now. Let's move on to the next section about the creation of the heavens and earth.\n\nNathan Fontaine: A antum ashaddu khalqan amis samaa banaha. Rafa'a samkaha fa sawwaha. Wa aghtasha laylaha wa akhraja duhaha.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Good! But notice the pronunciation - it's not \"u-bana-ha\", it can be \"banaaha\" if you're continuing or \"banah\" if you stop there. Both are correct according to how the Prophet ï·º recited it.\n\nNathan Fontaine: Okay, so \"Amis samaa banaaha\" when continuing?\n\nOsama Muhammad: Yes, exactly. Now, what does this section mean?\n\nNathan Fontaine: \"Are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven which He constructed? He raised its ceiling and proportioned it. And He darkened its night and extracted its brightness (morning light).\"\n\nOsama Muhammad: Perfect understanding! Allah is asking a rhetorical question - is creating humans harder, or creating the vast heavens? Obviously the heavens are far greater in creation. So if Allah can create the magnificent heavens, resurrection of humans is easy for Him.\n\nNathan Fontaine: [Practicing] Wa aghtasha laylaha wa akhraja duhaha.\n\nOsama Muhammad: The word \"أَغْطَشَ\" (aghtasha) - this is an interesting verb. It means He made dark, He covered with darkness. And \"دُحَاهَا\" (duhaha) means He brought out its brightness, its daytime. Can you repeat that line?\n\nNathan Fontaine: Wa aghtasha laylaha wa akhraja duhaha. \n\nOsama Muhammad: Again, a bit faster.\n\nNathan Fontaine: [Practicing multiple times] Wa aghtasha laylaha wa akhraja duhaha.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Good! Let's do the whole section one more time. Try to do it in one breath if you can.\n\nNathan Fontaine: A antum ashaddu khalqan amis samaa banaha. Rafa'a samkaha fa sawwaha. Wa aghtasha laylaha wa akhraja duhaha.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Excellent! Let's read from the Mushaf one more time to make sure you have it correct.\n\nNathan Fontaine: [Reading] A antum ashaddu khalqan amis samaa banaha. Rafa'a samkaha fa sawwaha. Wa aghtasha laylaha wa akhraja duhaha.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Alhamdulillah, very good! You're making excellent progress. The difficult part is that \"aghtasha laylaha\" - it's not an easy phrase to say quickly. \n\nNathan Fontaine: Yes, I need to practice that more. It's tiring trying to hold the breath for longer phrases.\n\nOsama Muhammad: That's normal! Your breath capacity will improve with practice. The more you recite, the easier it becomes. This is why we practice regularly - not just for memorization, but also for proper recitation technique.\n\nOsama Muhammad: For homework this week, I want you to:\n1. Memorize these verses firmly - especially the story of Musa and Fir'aun\n2. Reflect on the meaning of Fir'aun's arrogance and Allah's punishment \n3. Practice the pronunciation of \"wa aghtasha laylaha\" until it flows smoothly\n4. Think about the rhetorical question Allah asks - why would we doubt resurrection when He created the entire universe?\n\nNathan Fontaine: Okay inshaAllah, I'll practice these verses.\n\nOsama Muhammad: Alhamdulillah. Keep practicing inshaAllah. I'll see you next week inshaAllah.\n\nNathan Fontaine: Okay inshaAllah.\n\nOsama Muhammad: As-salamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.\n\nNathan Fontaine: Wa alaikum assalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.\n\n[END OF LESSON]",
