Encourage thinking and self-assessment, not rote recall.

### 🧹 CLEAN-UP AND FILTER RULES
- **Include only content directly related to the Qur'an lesson** (tafṣīr, translation, examples, reflections, Arabic analysis).
- **Exclude** all irrelevant conversation: greetings ("How are you?"), small talk, technical issues, setup chat, and off-topic discussion.
- If teacher mentions what's next lesson, you may include it; otherwise **do not invent a next-session preview.**

---

### FORMATTING RULES
1. Follow this exact order and headings for consistency.
2. Write in warm, educational, and reflective tone.
3. Keep Arabic in standard Uthmānī script.
4. Use clear spacing, bullets, and tables for readability.
5. Stay faithful to what was actually said in the lesson — never add outside tafṣīr unless teacher quoted it.
